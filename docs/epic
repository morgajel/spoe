The purpose of this project is to create a site where Authors can go to have their content beta-read. Site is meant as an author-to-author tool for critiqing snippets.

User Stories

Users should be able to log into to see an interface where they can submit a snippet or critique a snippet

There should be two classes of users; Authors and Reviewers. All users start out as Reviewers and see a Reviewer interface, but can be upgraded to author status by submitting a snippet.

Authors
- Authors should be able to upload a doc file or paste plain text.
  - Authors should have a simple interface for pasting plain text to submit a snippet.
  - There should be a separate field for the Authors to explain their content.
  - Authors should be able to tag the snippet similar to del.ic.io.us
  - Authors can use a "word replacer" to replace characters names if they wish to keep things secret.
     - must be capitalization agnostic
  - Must rate content: mature audiences(default), young adult, everyone

- Authors should see a list of their uploaded snippets as well as critiques for each one
  - Authors can mark snippets as public or private
  - Authors see new critiques along with the user
  - 

- Authors can request reviews via the buddy system- They post their snippet and are presented with a group of snippets of a similar size and can buddy with another author

- Each uploaded snippet can have multiple critiques

- After a critique is submitted, you can read

Reviewers
- users set their default review preferences- i.e. "what they're willing to review"
- users interested in short stories can select a posted snippet via a set of filters, which default to their preferences
  - Snippets appear anonymous to the reviewer.
- Reviewers can select a story based on a one-sentence substring example

- Reviewer reputation based on author feedback of critique

- Reviewers can become authors when they wish to post their own snippet

  - Paragraph
  - Scene
  - Chapter
  - Short Story
  - Novella
